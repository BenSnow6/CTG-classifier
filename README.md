# CTG-classifier
An analysis of different neural network architectures on a large CTG dataset including significance testing and performance analysis. Tensorflow and Keras are used in a Jupyter notebook to create the neural network models along with numpy, pandas and scikit learn for array manipulation and visualisations.
